# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview 
AutosRUs newest prototype, MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress.  Upper management called for the data analytics team to review the prodution data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.  In this challenge, we will do the following:
    - Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
    - Collect summmary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) if the  manufacturing lots
    - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
    - Design a statisical study to compare vehicle performance pf the MechaCar statiscal analysis


## Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
